							<h1>Challenges and an Empirical Evaluation Framework for Causal Inference with Natural Language</h1>
							<p class => Using natural language, such as text, for causal inference has enormous potential for impactful
							research in the computational social sciences and other domains.</p>

							<p>However, evaluating cuasal inference models for natural language is very challenging, as ground truth causal
							effects are few and far between.</p>

							<p>In this work, we present a series of 6 tasks which together compose a principled empirical evaluation 
							framework for causal inference in natural langauge.</p>
							<!-- <p class =>However, such notebooks have remained
								largely unanalyzed at scale, as labels are absent and require
								expert domain knowledge to generate. We present a new classification
								task for labeling computational notebook cells as stages in
								the data analysis process (i.e., data import, wrangling, exploration,
								modeling, and evaluation).</p> -->

						<h2>Paper (under review at KDD '20)</h2>
						<h3><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJ2K01-NXvgt6U6Q0QIVr2ZIXILkM4Yz/view>[PDF]</a></h3>
						<p><b>Abstract:</b> Modeling of natural language for causal inference is challenging, due to its unstructured and high dimensional nature.
						Despite these challenges, several models have been proposed and applied to computational social science questions.
						However, it is typically impossible to evaluate the validity of these studies' results due to the absence of counterfactuals in real world data.
						Without true counterfactuals, there is no principled way of determining which models correctly estimate treatment effects. 
						We show that different models often disagree with one another on real world tasks, demonstrating a critical need for principled empirical evaluation.
						To evaluate models for causal inference in natural language, we propose a framework using semi-synthetic data that reflects six key challenges of real world applications.
						By controlling the underlying causal structure of these data, we know the ground truth treatment effects,
						and can empirically evaluate the performance of nine commonly used models for causal inference.
						We find that while each model has different strengths, all of them struggle with significant bias on at least one challenge.
						Concerningly, on a challenge with no treatment effect present, 8 of the 9 models predicted a significant positive treatment effect, a false causal discovery.
						The only exception is our novel hierarchical causal variant of BERT, SHERBERT, which further performs better than other models tested on most tasks.
						While no benchmark can be fully representative of all challenges in natural language, the failure of all models on at least one challenge highlights the difficulty of causal inference in natural language and points to concrete areas for improvement.</p>

						<h2>Tasks</h2>
						<p>All code used for this publication, and datasets for each task, are available on <a href='https://github.com/behavioral-data/CausalInferenceChallenges'><i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.</p>
						<p>Each task is designed to evaluate a model's ability to handle one of 6 different challenges in natural language.
						Tasks have multiple levels of difficulty, allowing us to see how models perform at handling each challenge.</p>
						<p>Tasks consist of semi-synthetic data, generated by inserting synthetic comments into real reddit users' post histories
							according to a known probability distribution, allowing us to control the true ATE, and therefore empirically evaluate the bias of each model on each task.
							Semi-synthetic data provides the best of both worlds: the realism of real world data, with the principled structure and known ATE of synthetic data.
